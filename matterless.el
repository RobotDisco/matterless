;;; Commentary:

;; I have no idea how Emacs Lisp programs are written, let's find out!

;; No doubt I will be shamelessly inspired by the amazing slack client written
;; by Yuya Minami over at https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack/

;;; Code:

(require 'json)
(require 'request)

(defgroup matterless nil
  "Emacs Mattermost Client"
  :prefix "matterless-"
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom matterless-server-url nil
  "URL of the mattermost server we will be talking to."
  :type 'string
  :group 'matterless)

(defun matterless-api-prefix ()
  "Return the full url of the base Mattermost API path."
  (concat matterless-server-url "/api/v4/"))

(defcustom matterless-username nil
  "Username of our mattermost server."
  :type 'string
  :group 'matterless)

(defcustom matterless-password nil
  "User password of our mattermost server."
  :type 'string
  :group 'matterless)

(defun matterless-request-login ()
  "Login to mattermost."
  (let ((req (request
              (concat (matterless-api-prefix) "users/login")
              :data (json-encode `(("login_id" . ,matterless-username)
                                  ("password" . ,matterless-password)))
              :parser 'json-read
              :sync t)))
    (request-response-data req)))

(provide 'matterless)
